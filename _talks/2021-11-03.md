In higher category theory, $\infty$-groupoids are $\infty$-categories whose morphisms are weakly invertible at all orders. Every topological space has an associated $\infty$-groupoid, named its fundamental $\infty$-groupoid, which encodes the information of higher paths over the space. The statement that every space can be recovered up to homotopy from its fundamental $\infty$-groupoid is known as Grothendieckâ€™s homotopy hypothesis. In this presentation, we choose a model of $\infty$-categories based on topologically enriched categories, and discuss the homotopy hypothesis in this context.
