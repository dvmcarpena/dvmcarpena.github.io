    In these notes, we will present an introduction to hypercommutative algebras. This structure was discovered by Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde, and can be found with different names and small variations, like Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde algebras, formal Frobenius manifolds, genus zero reduction of Gromov-Witten theories or genus zero cohomological field theories. The hypercommutative algebra structure plays a crucial role in mathematical physics because it describes the algebraic structure of quantum cohomology of varieties.
