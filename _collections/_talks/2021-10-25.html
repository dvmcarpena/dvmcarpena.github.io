  In higher category theory, \(\infty\)-groupoids are \(\infty\)-categories whose morphisms are weakly invertible at all orders. Every topological space has an associated \(\infty\)-groupoid, named its fundamental \(\infty\)-groupoid, which encodes the information of higher paths over the space. The statement that every space can be recovered up to homotopy from its fundamental \(\infty\)-groupoid is known as Grothendieckâ€™s homotopy hypothesis. In this talk we present the model of \(\infty\)-categories based on topologically enriched categories, and discuss the homotopy hypothesis in this context.
