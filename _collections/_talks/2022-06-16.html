    A classifying space of a topological group \(G\) is a quotient of a contractible space by a proper free action of \(G\). There are a variety of functorial classifying space models, such as the Milgram model \(B\) based on the bar construction, or the classifying complex \(W\) for simplicial groups. The Milgram model can be generalized to topological group-like monoids, but the same does not happen with the classifying complex. In this talk, we present a simplicial model of a classifying space for topological group-like monoids by means of the homotopy coherent nerve. As an application, we describe a model of the fundamental \(\infty\)-groupoid of a topological space as a topologically enriched category using Moore paths.
